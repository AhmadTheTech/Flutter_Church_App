     - family: Inter
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf

       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Sahitya-Regular.ttf
     - family: Inter-Medium
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
     - family: Inter-bold
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
